# ERP Replication Project (BrainHack)

This repository contains a replication project developed as part of an ERP course
and prepared for a BrainHack event.

The goal of the project was to replicate the main ERP findings of a published study
using publicly available EEG data.

## Background

I am a PhD student in linguistics with a focus on cognitive linguistics and metaphor studies.
This project was my first hands-on experience working with EEG/ERP data and analysis pipelines.

## What I Worked On

- Exploring and understanding a publicly available EEG dataset
- Learning to work with MATLAB and ERPLAB
- Implementing an ERP preprocessing pipeline
- Replicating the main effects reported in the original study

## Tools & Methods

- MATLAB
- ERPLAB / EEGLAB
- ERP preprocessing
- Replication-based analysis

## Notes

This is a learning-focused project rather than a polished analysis pipeline.
Materials are shared for transparency and educational purposes.
